1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So I'm sure I'm pressing

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Oh, ain't you sick from above?

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You know you make my world light up

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
When I was young, when I was hurt

5
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It came to live me home

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Love is a dream and loves a truck

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh, no, I think I'm gonna speed my eyes up

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
When I was a river, try up

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It came to rain and fly

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This is a dream for me, dream for me

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
When I was so nervous, I'm all on a scene for me

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No, I just can't get it alone

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I just can't get it alone

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I choose a reason for me

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
When I was so nervous, I'm all on a scene for me

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
When I was so nervous, I'm all on a scene for me

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm feeling drunk and I'm so high

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So high, so high

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Oh, I'm feeling drunk and I'm so high

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Oh, no, I think I'm gonna speed my eyes up

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I ain't you sick from above?

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I feel your colds in through my blood

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Love is a dream and your love's about to make the stars come out

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's wings on me, wings on me

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
When I was so heavy, I'm all on a scene for me

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
When I was so nervous, I'm all on a scene for me

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:06,000
When I was so nervous, I'm all on a scene for me

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
When I was so nervous, I'm all on a scene for me

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh, I'm feeling drunk and I'm so high

30
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:46,500
souls

31
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:57,700
dramatic

32
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,700
I'm a sure I'm Christ

33
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,700
I'm a sure I'm Christ

34
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,700
I'm a sure I'm Christ
